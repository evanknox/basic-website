While I was looking at Duke's recently-released list of courses for Spring 2021, I ran across STA 771S, one of two PhD-level courses my department lists that are focused on teaching statistics.  The other is one of many versions of STA 790 (our catch-all number for "special topics"), so it's unsurprising that it hasn't been taught recently (I see some info on it from 2012, by a professor who left some time ago).  However, it seems that STA 771S, in addition to being easier to search for, has also been taught much more recently -- in fact, in Fall 2018, with some focus on preparing teaching statements for prospective faculty searches at PUI's and for teaching-track positions more generally.  The professor, Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel, is still affiliated with our department; however, I don't have much hope of her teaching this class in the near future (at least here, rather than in  Edinburgh); as such, I intend to work through the class' topics myself, and provide some of my own opinions thereof.  I don't and likely never will have the standing to critique Dr. Cetinkaya-Rundel's thoughts on teaching statistics, so my opinions are more intended to answer open-ended questions about the class than to question her judgments.

Discussion Q's:
What do you know about a "traditional" intro statistics curriculum? What topics / contents from this curriculum should we hold on to? What can go, and why?
What are biggest challenges to moving to a more computational intro statistics curriculum?
What do you want to get out of this course? Add notes to course Etherpad.
